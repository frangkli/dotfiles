# Dotfiles

Obviously this is a repository for my configuration files.
This repository is managed using the bare repository trick, so all file paths should be exactly the same as my local setup.

## My Setup

I have multiple computers with different operating systems and setups.
This is my macbook setup in which I use the config files in this repository.

- Laptop: LG gram
- Operating system: windows 11
- Terminal: windows terminal
- Shell: zsh without oh-my-zsh (used to use bash)
- Color scheme: one dark
- Editor: nvim
- File manager: lf, ranger (fzf for fuzzy search)
